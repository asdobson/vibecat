### Core Features

- **Spotify BPM Sync** - Cat automatically dances to the beat of your music
- **Click-Through Mode** - Make the cat non-interactive (Ctrl+Alt+T)
- **Always On Top** - Stays visible above all windows
- **Portable** - Single exe file, no installation required

### Window Modes
- **Cat Mode** (default) - Just the cat, draggable
- **UI Mode** (double-click) - Shows controls and settings
- **Click-Through Mode** (Ctrl+Alt+T) - Cat becomes non-interactive

### Customization
- **Window Opacity** - Make the cat more or less transparent
- **Edge Snapping** - Cat snaps to screen edges when dragged
- **Horizontal Flipping** - Cat faces the right direction
- **Manual BPM Control** - Set custom speed (60-180 BPM)
- **Resizable** - Adjust size while maintaining aspect ratio

## üìñ How to Use

### Basic Controls
| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Show/Hide UI | Double-click the cat |
| Move window | Click and drag |
| Toggle click-through | Ctrl+Alt+T or system tray |
| Resize | Drag corner grip (UI mode) |
| Close | Click X button (UI mode) |

### UI Mode Controls
- **Settings** - Configure opacity, snapping, BPM
- **Hotkeys** - View all keyboard shortcuts
- **Minimize/Close** - Standard window controls
- **Resize Grip** - Bottom-right corner

### Click-Through Mode
When enabled, the cat becomes purely decorative:
- Cannot be clicked or dragged
- Mouse clicks pass through to windows below
- Toggle via system tray or Ctrl+Alt+T
- Icon changes in system tray (filled = interactive, outline = click-through)

## üéµ Spotify Integration

2. Click "Connect Spotify"
3. Log in with your Spotify account
4. Grant permission for "user-read-playback-state"
5. Return to VibeCat - you're connected!

### How It Works
- Monitors your currently playing track
- Fetches BPM data for each song

- No data is stored except your refresh token (encrypted locally)
- Disconnect anytime via Settings
